# Flow Control

## What you'll find

This folder contains an example test, and is composed of the following elements:
- `README.md`: (This file) Contains the purpose of the test.
- `input.yaml`: Sets variables that will provided to test.
- `unit.yaml`: Sets the steps to perform while executing the test.

You can also get familiar with our test script syntax by following our [Synthax Documentation](https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl-apix-example/blob/main/docs/README.md).

## Details

Flow control can be achieved with components like `each` or `if`

## Features
- We use `IF` to determine whether execute or not a collection of instruction
- We use `EACH`, to walktough a collection and execute operations or assertions over each item in the collection
